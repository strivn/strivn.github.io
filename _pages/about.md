üëãüèª Hi!

I was a consultant working collaboratively with various functions and clients across industries to help realizing the value of data and technology while maintaining its protection. Now, I'm currently an upcoming graduate student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu).

Bit of an background - I'm deeply curious about the intricate interplay between business, technology, and society. This interest has propelled me into the field of [Personal Data Protection/Privacy](https://iapp.org/about/what-is-privacy/) and [Responsible AI](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/ai-analytics/responsible-ai-for-generative-ai.html). I enjoy diving into the regulatory and legal aspects, technical engineering, design and user experience, ethical considerations, and also exploring the historical and social context. The problem is multidisciplinary, and which is why I believe that a diverse palette of interest is required on top of working collaboratively!

Outside of professional work, I love taking pictures, reading books, and enjoying coffee. If you have any book or coffee recommendations, do let me know!
