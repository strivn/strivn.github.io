## Thrilled to share some recent milestones!

First, Iâ€™ve just said goodbye to the â€˜community of solversâ€™ at PwC Indonesia after ~3.5 years of growth. I'm grateful to have been a part of both 'Cybersecurity & Privacy' and 'Data & Analytics' teams, while also collaborating with Legal, Advisory, and Assurance groups. Itâ€™s been a ride with its fair share of challenges, but these challenges and the amazing people Iâ€™ve worked with is what makes it a profound learning experience. I'm truly grateful to have had the chance to work alongside them.

Second, as a step of continuous learning, I'm proud to share I've received my second certification from [IAPP - International Association of Privacy Professionals](https://iapp.org), Certified Information Privacy Technologist (CIPT)! It has inspired me to learn more about privacy risks and privacy engineering.

Lastly, and the one I am most excited about: honored to be named as an Lembaga Pengelola Dana Pendidikan (LPDP) scholarship awardee, and looking forward to joining Carnegie Mellon University this Fall to further pursue my studies!

It's been an extraordinary journey thus far, and so excited for more journey ahead! ðŸ¥³
